# Day 2: Leetcode Practice (Easy to Medium) + Time Complexity

## Leetcode Problem Practice:
- Focus on problems involving lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation, as theyâ€™re common.
- Search for easy-to-medium Leetcode problems like:
  - [Two Sum (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) 
  - [Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
  - [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
  - [Group Anagrams (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
  - [Product of Array Except Self (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

## Review Time Complexity:
- Understand how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms (Big O notation).
- Pay attention to runtime constraints, and ensure you can optimize your solution if necessary.
- Example: If a brute force solution is O(n^2), ask yourself how you can bring it down to O(n log n) or O(n).

## Implement the Shopping Cart Problem:
- Expand the shopping cart example to handle more complex requirements like discount codes, applying tax, and handling different currencies.
- Practice explaining your design decisions clearly, as you may be asked about them in an interview.
